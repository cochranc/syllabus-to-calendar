### Set Up

- The library PDFBox was used for the purposes of reading PDFs. 
To run this program, you also need to include this library. \
Instructions to use PDFBox can be found at: \
[pdfbox.apache.org/](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) \
[javatpoint.com/pdfbox-environment-setup](https://www.javatpoint.com/pdfbox-environment-setup)

- You will also need at least one syllabus in PDF form. An example syllabus was included. 

### Running
- Run the program and a dialog box should pop up. 
- Select one or more pdf(s), enter your start and end date, and select submit. 

### Have fun viewing your assignments!
